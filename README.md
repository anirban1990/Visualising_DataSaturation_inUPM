# Visualising_DataSaturation_inUPM
This repository lists codes to visualise data saturation in a spatial process when UPM is used for mapping. The example dataset is from a numerical experiment where we make a hypothetical model of the wave amplification in an alluvial valley as a spatial process. Please refer to the "Readme.txt" for more details on using the codes.
